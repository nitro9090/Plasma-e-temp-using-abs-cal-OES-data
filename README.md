# Plasma-e-temp-using-abs-cal-OES-data
Using absolutely calibrated optical emission spectrum (OES) for an Ar and O2 plasma, code can find approximate electron temperatures

This code was created to determine the electron temperature in a CO2 plasma with an argon additive.  By inputting a set of OES 
data, background data and calibration lamp data into the code, it will absolutely calibrate the data, find the peak values of 
Ar and O2 lines in the spectrum (the decay of CO2 in a plasma creates O2) and plots the intensity versus energy (IVE) of 
the lines in order to find the electron temperature.  This technique has a large amount of error, but should give a ballpark 
electron temperature value for most plasmas.

The code is commmented, but if anyone needs help with it feel free to contact me.
